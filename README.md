# Typing Speed Test
This is a simple web-based Typing Speed Test application that allows users to test how fast they can type predefined sample texts. The application calculates the time taken and the typing speed in words per minute (WPM) once the user finishes typing the given text.

## Features
- Displays random sample text for the user to type.
- Tracks typing progress and compares it with the sample text.
- Calculates the time taken to complete the test.
- Displays the user's typing speed in words per minute (WPM).
- Simple and responsive design using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Files
- `index.html`: The HTML structure of the typing speed test.
- `styles.css`: The CSS for styling the application.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript for managing the logic of the typing test.

## How to Use
1. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
2. Click the "Start Test" button to begin.
3. Type the displayed text into the textarea as quickly and accurately as possible.
4. The test will end automatically once you finish typing the text correctly.
5. Your results, including the time taken and words per minute (WPM), will be displayed.

## Requirements
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.).
- No additional software or installations required.

## How it Works
- Upon clicking "Start Test," a random sample text from a list is displayed.
- The timer starts as soon as the user starts typing.
- The test ends when the user matches the exact text, and the speed in words per minute (WPM) is calculated based on the time taken.

## Customization
You can customize the sample texts by modifying the `sampleTexts` array in the `script.js` file. You can add more sample sentences or edit the existing ones to match your needs.

## Example

- **Sample Texts**:
    - "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
    - "A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step."
    - "To be or not to be, that is the question."
    - "Success is not the key to happiness. Happiness is the key to success."
